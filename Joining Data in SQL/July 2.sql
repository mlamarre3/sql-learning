ðŸ”· 1. Urban Core Leaders
Find the 10 cities where the urban area population makes up the highest percentage of the metro area population.
Only include cities in capital cities of countries located in Africa or Asia. Return city name, country code, urban %, and sort by percentage descending.

SELECT name, 100 * urbanarea_pop / metroarea_pop AS urban_%
FROM cities
WHERE name IN(
    SELECT capital
    FROM countries
    WHERE continent IN ('Africa', 'Asia')
)
ORDER BY urban_% DESC
LIMIT 10;

ðŸ”· 2. Language Saturation
Which countries have more than 5 total languages listed in the languages table? Return the country name and number of languages.
Use a subquery inside the SELECT clause.

SELECT country_name, (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM languages
    WHERE languages.code = countries.code
) AS lang_num
FROM countries
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM languages
    WHERE languages.code = countries.code) > 5;



ðŸ”· 3. Unmatched Inflation
Find all countries that are Constitutional Monarchies but do not have any inflation_rate recorded in the year 2015.
Return the country name and government form.

SELECT country_name, gov_form
FROM countries
WHERE gov_form = 'Constitutional Monarchy'
AND code NOT IN (
    SELECT code 
    FROM economies
    WHERE year = 2015
);


ðŸ”· 4. City Concentration in Oceania
Return all countries in Oceania where at least one of its cities accounts for more than 70% of its largest metro area population.
Return country name and city name. Use a subquery to compare city proper to metro area size.

SELECT c.country_name, ci.name
FROM countries AS c
JOIN cities AS ci
ON c.code = ci.country_code
WHERE c.continent = 'Oceania'
AND 1.0 * city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop > 0.7
AND metroarea_pop IS NOT NULL;

ðŸ”· 5. Above-Average Survivors
In 2015, which countries had a life expectancy that was greater than the average across all countries that year?
Return country name, life expectancy, and region.

SELECT c.name, p.life_expectancy, c.region
FROM countries AS c
LEFT JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
WHERE p.year = 2015
AND p.life_expectancy > (
    SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
    FROM populations
    WHERE year = 2015
);
